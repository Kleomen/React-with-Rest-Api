# RapidAPI Integration Project – React Assessment
This project was developed as a technical assessment after an interview round. It showcases my ability to build a modern React application that consumes data from RapidAPI, demonstrating skills in API integration, UI development, and asynchronous data handling.

## 🔍 Project Objective
Build a small front-end application using React that connects to a public API via RapidAPI, fetches and renders data dynamically, and showcases clean UI and code organization.

## 🚀 Features
🔗 API Integration via RapidAPI
Makes authenticated requests to a selected public API using RapidAPI headers and endpoints.

## ⚛️ React Frontend
Built using React functional components and Hooks (useEffect, useState) for clean state management.

## 💡 Clean UI & Logic Separation
Emphasizes reusable components, logical data handling, and separation of concerns.

## 📡 Asynchronous Data Fetching
All data loading and error handling are done using modern async/await syntax and error boundaries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* React (JavaScript)
* RapidAPI
* Axios (or native fetch, depending on implementation)
* HTML5 & CSS3
